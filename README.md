# Encryption-Algorithm
International Data Encryption Algorithm(IDEA)
IDEA is one of the encryption algorithms that is widely used for security purpose. IDEA block cipher operates with 64-bit plain text block and 64-bit cipher text block, and a 128-bit key controls it. The fundamental design of the algorithm is using three different algebraic operations: bitwise Exclusive OR, multiplication modulo, and addition modulo. Having the largest number of weak keys is one of the drawbacks of IDEA
